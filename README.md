# Telemanipulator

This master's thesis focuses on the development, configuration and integration of a telemedicine manipulator that can be controlled through a web application for performing identified tasks in healthcare environments. The objective is to design and implement a user-friendly interface that enables remote operators to control the manipulator without direct physical contact. The tasks performed by the manipulator include grasping and moving objects, such as a box of medicine or surgical instruments. The implemented application provides features such as motion parameter registration, real-time task execution tracking, visual feedback, and automatic detection of task completion or failure.
